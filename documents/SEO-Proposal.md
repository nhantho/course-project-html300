## Importance of SEO & Analytics

#### Importance of SEO
Search Engine Optimization is the process of getting visitors to your site organically (unpaid) from the search results on search engines.

Since you have a website, you want people to see it. SEO affects the visibility of your site when people search for sites like yours. Your website has to tell the search engine that it matches what the user is searching for.  


#### Importance of Analytics
Using a service such as Google Analytics, and frequently reviewing the data will help the website be more successful. With analytics, you can see what content users are visiting the most, and what they are visiting the least. You can add more content similar to what is popular, and remove unpopular content. This is also helpful to know what areas of your site you should be spending time on to promote.

Analytics can also help tell you WHO is coming to your site, to help you target your audience better. You can also find out WHAT they are coming to your site on. If most of your users are on mobile devices when coming to your site, then it is worth it to structure your site to benefit mobile audiences the most.

## Implementation of SEO
It will be important to have a good structure to the site, with just one main heading per page. This header should also have the most important information about that page.

For this site, as a bar/restaurant, it will be important to be found by the right audiences. People who go to restaurants are going to be looking in a certain area. It will be important that the location and theme of the site is easily picked up by Google/other search engines to make sure the site is found in a search such as "restaurants in the Seattle area" or "best bars in Seattle on the weekend."

Social network sharing should be promoted, with links to social media sites. Content on the site, such as articles/images, should also be shared on social media to increase site visitation. Each page/image could also have a "share with your friends" button to increase outreach. As a restaurant, Facebook, Instagram, and yelp would be good places to focus attention and content.

Other general good practice would be to make sure your most descriptive content is in text (not in images) and all images need to have alt text.
