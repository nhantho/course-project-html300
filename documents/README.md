# HTML300 - Lesson 01: The Plan

## Course Project Proposal
For my course project I would like to create a travel agency website. This would be an interesting project for me to do, since I am also interested in travel.

For the scope of this project, I'll just focus on just a few travel destinations.

### Objectives for the site:
* Users can find information and ideas about their travel destinations
* Users can check flight availability for trips

## API Selection
Skyscanner Flight Search

https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search/details

The Sky Scanner API lets you search for flight & get flight prices from Skyscanners database of prices, as well as get live quotes directly from ticketing agencies.
